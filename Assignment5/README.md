# Assignment 5

## Simulation of Dijkstra's routing algorithm
Files `Graph.cpp` and `Graph.h` contain the class for implementing the Dijkstra's algorithm. The file `dijkstras.cpp` contains an example graph for testing the algorithm.
### Compile and Run
Run the following commands to compile the code
```shell
g++ dijkstras.cpp Graph.cpp -std=c++17 -o dijkstras
```
and run using
```shell
./dijkstras
```
#### Notes
* The code has been tested for C++ standard 11 and above. Replace `-std=c++17` with a version of your choice, if needed.
